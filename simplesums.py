# Step 1: Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8
first_number = 8

# Step 2: Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10
second_number = 10

# Step 3: Declare a third variable that stores the sum of the first two numbers
sum_of_numbers = first_number + second_number

# Step 4: Print the value of the sum to the console
